### God/Melody
1. Root (Neural Network)
   - Italian
   - Melody is our divine inheritence
      - We are called on to reharm it
      - But [The Social Network's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network) director & screenwriters don't savor each scene 
      - Our director believes the story, or song, is his to tell
      - And rushes us through scenes, because he can't wait to unveil it
      - Premature mastication of cadences
      - Yet our lots task is reharm: painting the tone colors within which we'll savor the melody
      - However, this story & melody belongs to the pantheon of neural networks
         - It has a non-linear structure (appropriately  so for neural nerworks)
         - Anchored in the law-suits (false ownership bred by capitalism)
         - With five notes on a pentatonic scale, a universal, can you file a law suit against someone with similar melody? Nodes, edges?
         - Forrrus, we view this as divine inheritence (neural networks)
         - Lets anchor The Social Network on this premise. Amen! 
2. Pentatonic (Layers of Network)
   - Aperitivo
   - Antipasto
   - Primo
   - Secondo
   - Contorno

### Man/Rhythm
5. Temperament: Caff√© (Fine-tune)
6. Expression: Digestivo (Adversarial Networks)
   - Physical
   - Communal
      - Social Network's director & screenwriters don't savor each scene 
   - Transendental: Pantheon (they've all enriched our collective neural networks)
      - Gates, Allen
      - Jobs, Woz
      - Page, Brin
