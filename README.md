### God/Melody
1. Root
   - Italian
   - Melody is our divine inheritence
      - We are called on to reharm it
      - But [The Social Network's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network) director & screenwriters don't savor each scene 
      - Our director believes the story, or song, is his to tell
      - And rushes us through scenes, because he can't wait to unveil it
      - Premature mastication of cadences
      - Yet our lots task is reharm: painting the tone colors within which we'll savor the melody
