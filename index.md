# Brains

Neural networks are essentially a type of software. They are implemented as algorithms within software frameworks and run on hardware. To break it down:

1. **Software Aspect**: Neural networks are composed of layers of algorithms that mimic the structure and function of the human brain to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are designed and coded using programming languages like Python, and implemented using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. The training, tuning, and deployment of neural networks are all software processes.

2. **Hardware Aspect**: While the neural networks themselves are software, they require hardware to run. The performance of neural networks, especially deep learning models, often depends on powerful hardware such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). These specialized hardware components accelerate the processing of the large amounts of data and complex calculations involved in training neural networks.

So, neural networks are fundamentally software, but they rely on hardware for execution and optimization.
